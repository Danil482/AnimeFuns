                            <p>Rumor has it that the local forests are inhabited by bloodthirsty demons who feed on human flesh.
                                 That's just the last incidents were so long ago that people forgot about the dangers of dense forests.
                                  Many villagers believe that the legend of demons is just horror stories and legends.
                                   Tanjiro Kamado lives in a small village, and he takes care of his family, because his father has recently disappeared.
                                 The guy has to work at the mine and sell coal in the city.
                                  Another trip to the market did not promise trouble, but upon returning home, a monstrous sight awaited the guy.
                                   Kamado saw the bloodied bodies of relatives that were scattered in the yard.
                                    It turned out that forest demons attacked the village and slaughtered all the inhabitants.
                                     Nezuko's sister miraculously managed to survive, but she also had problems, because the creatures turned her into a demon.</p>

                            <img src="img/blog/details/bd-item-3.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Cornered humanity is living out its last days under the yoke of titans - 
                                mysterious creatures that terrorize the human race. 
                                The survivors huddle behind the walls of a large settlement with its own government, 
                                representing the last stronghold of centralized power in the world. 
                                A young man named Eren also lives there, spending his childhood in relative safety until 
                                an out-of-the-ordinary event occurs: titans break into the city, destroying everything in their path. 
                                After the invasion of the giants, Eren becomes an orphan and vows to destroy every single Titans.
                                 On the way to his goal, he and his friends join a reconnaissance squad engaged in sorties over the wall. 
                                 The hero does not yet know how many mysteries the outside world conceals.</p>
